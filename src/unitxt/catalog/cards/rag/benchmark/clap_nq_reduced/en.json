There is a simple cycle of three \"normal\" years followed by a leap year and this pattern repeats forever without exception. \r\n The Julian year is, therefore, on average 365.25 days long.   As a result, the calendar year gains about three days every four centuries compared to observed equinox times and the seasons.   The Gregorian calendar has the same months and month lengths as the Julian calendar, but, in the Gregorian calendar, year numbers evenly divisible by 100 are not leap years, except that those evenly divisible by 400 remain leap years.  This means since 16 February Julian (1 March 1900 Gregorian) and until 15 February Julian (28 February 2100 Gregorian) Julian is 13 days behind Gregorian and the disparity will widen."

That many of his plays were pirated suggests his popularity in the book market, and the regular patronage of his company by the court, culminating in 1603 when James I turned it into the `` King's Men,'' suggests his popularity among higher stations of society.  Modern plays were considered ephemeral and even somewhat disreputable entertainments by some contemporaries.  Some of Shakespeare's plays, particularly the history plays, were reprinted frequently in cheap quarto form; others took decades to reach a 3rd edition."

The view however was challenged by Qing dynasty philologist Cui Shu who argued on linguistic ground that the last five books are much later than the rest of the work. Because no texts of the Analects have been discovered earlier, and because the Analects was not referred to by name in any existing source before the early Han dynasty, some scholars have proposed dates as late as 140 BC for the text's compilation."
