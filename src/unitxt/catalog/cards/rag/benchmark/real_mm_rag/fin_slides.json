The benchmark was constructed using an automated pipeline, where queries were generated by a vision-language model (VLM), filtered by a large language model (LLM), and rephrased by an LLM to ensure high-quality retrieval evaluation. To simulate real-world retrieval challenges, we introduce multi-level query rephrasing, modifying queries at three distinct levels—from minor wording adjustments to significant structural changes—ensuring models are tested on their true semantic understanding rather than simple keyword matching."
