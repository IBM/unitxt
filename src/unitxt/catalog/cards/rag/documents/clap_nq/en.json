    "__description__": "CLAP NQ is created from the subset of Natural Questions (NQ) that have a long answer but no short answer. NQ consists of ~380k examples. There are ~30k questions that are long answers without short answers excluding tables and lists. To increases the likelihood of longer answers we only explored ones that have more than 5 sentences in the passage. The subset that was annotated consists of ~12k examples. All examples where cohesion of non-consecutive sentences was required for the answer were annotated a second time. The final dataset is made up of all data that went through two rounds of annotation. (We provide the single round annotations as well - it is only training data) An equal amount of unanswerable questions have also been added from the original NQ train/dev sets. Details about the annotation task and unanswerables can be found at https://github.com/primeqa/clapnq/blob/main/annotated_data.",
