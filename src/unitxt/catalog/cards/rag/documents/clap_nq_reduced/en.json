As these territories became U.S. states , state governments sought to dissolve the boundaries of the Indian nations within their borders , which were independent of state jurisdiction , and to expropriate the land therein . These pressures were exacerbated by U.S. population growth and the expansion of slavery in the South , with the rapid development of cotton cultivation in the uplands following the invention of the cotton gin .",

Christians who accept a literal interpretation of the biblical account of creation find incompatibility between Darwinian evolution and their interpretation of the Christian faith . Creation science or scientific creationism is a branch of creationism that attempts to provide scientific support for the Genesis creation narrative in the Book of Genesis and attempts to disprove generally accepted scientific facts , theories and scientific paradigms about the history of the Earth , cosmology and biological evolution . It began in the 1960s as a fundamentalist Christian effort in the United States to prove Biblical inerrancy and falsify the scientific evidence for evolution . It has since developed a sizable religious following in the United States , with creation science ministries branching worldwide . In 1925 , The State of Tennessee passed the Butler Act , which prohibited the teaching of the theory of evolution in all schools in the state . Later that year , a similar law was passed in Mississippi , and likewise , Arkansas in 1927 . In 1968 , these `` anti-monkey '' laws were struck down by the Supreme Court of the United States as unconstitutional , `` because they established a religious doctrine violating both the First and Fourth Amendments to the Constitution .",

Two days later , on August 4 , another portion of the boat chase using Hacker Craft sport boats , was filmed at Tilbury Docks in Essex . The shot of the boats passing between two ships was achieved by first cabling the ships off so they would be safe . The ships were moved together while the boats passed between , close enough that one of the boats scraped the sides of the ships . An empty speedboat containing dummies was launched from a floating platform between the ships amid fire and smoke that helped obscure the platform .

It implied that the transmutations lead to the unfolding of a preordained plan that had been woven into the laws that governed the universe . In this sense it was less completely materialistic than the ideas of radicals like Grant , but its implication that humans were only the last step in the ascent of animal life incensed many conservative thinkers .

Adam succumbs to Eve just as Gawain surrenders to Bertilak 's wife by accepting the girdle . Although Gawain sins by putting his faith in the girdle and not confessing when he is caught , the Green Knight pardons him , thereby allowing him to become a better Christian by learning from his mistakes . Through the various games played and hardships endured , Gawain finds his place within the Christian world .",

Infants , toddlers , and pregnant women have higher than average needs . Increased iron intake is also needed to offset blood losses due to digestive tract issues , frequent blood donations , or heavy menstrual periods . Iron is an essential part of hemoglobin , and low iron levels result in decreased incorporation of hemoglobin into red blood cells . In the United States , 12 % of all women of childbearing age have iron deficiency , compared with only 2 % of adult men . The incidence is as high as 20 % among African American and Mexican American women . Studies have shown iron deficiency without anemia causes poor school performance and lower IQ in teenage girls , although this may be due to socioeconomic factors . Iron deficiency is the most prevalent deficiency state on a worldwide basis . It is sometimes the cause of abnormal fissuring of the angular ( corner ) sections of the lips ( angular stomatitis ) . In the United States , the most common cause of iron deficiency is bleeding or blood loss , usually from the gastrointestinal tract . Fecal occult blood testing , upper endoscopy and lower endoscopy should be performed to identify bleeding lesions . In older men and women , the chances are higher that bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract could be due to colon polyps or colorectal cancer . Worldwide , the most common cause of iron deficiency anemia is parasitic infestation ( hookworms , amebiasis , schistosomiasis and whipworms ) .",
