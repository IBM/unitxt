    "__description__": "The data contains a diverse set of prompts covering 70 hypothetical decision scenarios, ranging from approving a loan to providing press credentials. Each prompt instructs the model to make a binary decision (yes/no) about a particular person described in the prompt. Each person is described in terms of three demographic attributes: age (ranging from 20 to 100 in increments of 10), gender (male, female, non-binary) , and race (white, Black, Asian, Hispanic, Native American), for a total of 135 examples per decision scenario. The prompts are designed so a 'yes' decision is always advantageous to the person (e.g. deciding to grant the loan).",
