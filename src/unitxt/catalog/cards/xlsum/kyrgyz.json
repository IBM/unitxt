The dataset covers 45 languages ranging from low to high-resource, for many of which no public dataset is currently available. XL-Sum is highly abstractive, concise, and of high quality, as indicated by human and intrinsic evaluation… See the full description on the dataset page: https://huggingface.co/datasets/GEM/xlsum"
