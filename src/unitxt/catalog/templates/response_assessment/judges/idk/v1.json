Market Cap is the share price multiplied by the number of shares, representing what people think the company is worth based on their perception of its value. On the other hand, NAV is how much the company's stuff is worth divided by the number of shares, also known as book value. It represents the total value of the company's assets minus its liabilities, divided by the number of outstanding shares. \nThe main difference is that Market Cap is based on the stock price, which can be influenced by market expectations and perceptions, while NAV is based on the company's assets and liabilities, which provides a more objective measure of the company's worth. \n\n\nOutput:",
