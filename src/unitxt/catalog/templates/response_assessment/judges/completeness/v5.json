Generate your answer as a label with one of these values: yes, no, unsure, followed by an explanation of the label.\n   - Choose label \"yes\" if all substantive information in document necessary to address the inquiry has been included in the response.\n   - Choose label \"no\" if you have identified an essential piece of information from the document missing from the response.  Make sure that if you choose \"no\", you must mention in the explanation at least one piece of missing information quoted from the document.\n   - Choose label \"unsure\" if ambiguity in the conversation, response, or the document makes it unclear whether an essential part of the the response is omitted. \n\n\n[Document]\nThe company offers the Dependent Care Spending Account program.
