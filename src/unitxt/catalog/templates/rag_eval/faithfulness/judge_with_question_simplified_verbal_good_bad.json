If the prediction is correct but not present in the evidence - it is not grounded.\nThe question is only given for context, and is irrelevant for determining the groundedness of the prediction.\nProvide a rating from one of the following choices: 'Very Bad', 'Bad', 'Mediocre', 'Good', 'Very Good'. Reply using the format of [[rating]], for example: '[[Mediocre]]'.\n"
