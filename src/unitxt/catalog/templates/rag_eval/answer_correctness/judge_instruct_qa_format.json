Answer with only yes/no.\nYou are given a question, the corresponding ground-truth answer and a prediction from a model. Compare the \"Ground-truth answer\" and the \"Prediction\" to determine whether the prediction correctly answers the question. All information in the ground-truth answer must be present in the prediction, including numbers and dates. You must answer \"no\" if there are any specific details in the ground-truth answer that are not mentioned in the prediction. There should be no contradicting statements in the prediction. The prediction may contain extra information. If the prediction states something as a possibility, treat it as a definitive answer.\n\n"
