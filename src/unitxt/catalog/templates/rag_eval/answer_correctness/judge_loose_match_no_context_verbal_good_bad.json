Compare the \"Ground-truth answer\" and the \"Prediction\" to determine whether the prediction correctly answers the question.\nThere should be no contradicting statements in the prediction. The prediction may contain extra information. If the prediction states something as a possibility, treat it as a definitive answer.\nThe prediction must contain all the important information presented in the ground truths, but doesn't have to fully match it.\nProvide a rating from one of the following choices: 'Very Bad', 'Bad', 'Mediocre', 'Good', 'Very Good'. Reply using the format of [[rating]], for example: '[[Mediocre]]'.\n"
