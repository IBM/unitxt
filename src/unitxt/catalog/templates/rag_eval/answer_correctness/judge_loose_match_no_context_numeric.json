Compare the \"Ground-truth answer\" and the \"Prediction\" to determine whether the prediction correctly answers the question.\nThere should be no contradicting statements in the prediction. The prediction may contain extra information. If the prediction states something as a possibility, treat it as a definitive answer.\nThe prediction must contain all the important information presented in the ground truths, but doesn't have to fully match it.\nOn a scale of 0 to 10, to what extent does the prediction answer the question? Reply with your rating score without any preceding explanation.\n"
