By default uses an accuracy (exact match) between each for the fields.\nReports average accuracy for each key , as well as micro and macro averages across all keys.\n                            \nBy overriding the metric field, it is possible to use other metrics to compare corresponding key values.\nFor example, KeyValueExtraction(metric=token_overlap) will calculate token overlap between corresponding keys.\n                             \n"
