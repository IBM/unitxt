Using any meditation, such as mindfulness meditation, teaches you to focus your mind. When you're able to focus better, you're also better able to solidify concepts in your short-term memory. Therefore, practicing meditation can help you to develop your short-term memory.\n1. **Start today.** You may be surprised that you don't need to practice meditation for that long to start seeing the effects. One scientific study examined how a group of students responded to meditation. With just two weeks of meditation practice (10 minutes a day, plus 4 45-minute classes a week), the students significantly improved their GRE scores (a standardized test given to students trying to get into graduate school).\nIn fact, some studies show as little as four days of meditation can improve your attention span and memory.\n2. **Practice often.** Practicing every day is ideal. Doing so will help you work to increase your memory. In fact, spreading it out throughout the day can be helpful, such as meditating for 10 minutes in the morning, 10 minutes at lunch, and 10 minutes in the evening. However, if you find you can't practice every day, do it as often as you can.\n3. **Cultivate mindfulness.** Mindfulness is a part of meditation, but it's also something you can incorporate in your day-to-day life. Mindfulness, at its most basic, just means paying attention. In other words, place yourself in the moment, rather then letting your mind race elsewhere.\n\nFor instance, when you're in the shower, stop yourself from thinking about the day ahead. Instead, focus on what the shower feels like. Feel the heat of the water on your skin, how the soap feels against your body. Pay attention to the pleasant scent of your soap or shampoo. Let yourself really feel each sensation.\nYou can practice this technique anywhere. For instance, while you're washing dishes, take a moment to really focus on what you're doing. Let yourself feel the warm water on your skin, the weight of a plate in your hands. Put your full attention on getting the plate clean, making sure it's spotless.\n4. **Work your way up.** You may want to jump in with an hour-long meditation every day. However, most people can't sustain that kind of practice when they haven't meditated before. It's best to start small and work up to more time. You can start with as little as three minutes a day.\n5. **Pick a place to meditate.** Really, you can meditate anywhere, but it's good to choose a place that's not distracting, particularly when you're first starting out. Turn off the television, and move away from distractions. You can even set up a little meditation center in a corner of your house, with a candle and something you like to focus on.\n6. **Sit properly.** You can sit in a chair or on the floor. It's up to you. However, make sure you are relatively comfortable. You don't want a lot of pressure on one part of your body, for instance. Try to sit up straight, though not so much that it feels like a strain.\n7. **Get settled.** Spend a few minutes just bringing yourself into the right state of mind. Focus on the candle, if that helps. You don't have to be completely focused, but as you feel your mind wander, bring it back to the center, to the moment.\n8. **Focus on your breathing.** Once you've situated yourself, try paying attention to just your breathing. Focus on it going in and out. You don't have to change it up. Rather, just keep your attention on it, focusing all of yourself on breathing in and out. As your mind wanders, bring it back to your breath.\n9. **Keep bringing yourself back.** The longer you sit, the more likely your mind is to wander. That's okay. It's normal in fact. The important thing is to acknowledge that you've wandered and move back to your focus. Try labeling it when your mind wanders, such as saying \"thinking\" in your head, and then refocusing on your breath.\n10. **Try deep breathing.** One simple way to get started with meditation is to try deep breathing. Start by placing a hand on your chest and a hand on your stomach. When you breathe, you should notice your stomach expanding more than your chest, as you are trying to breathe as deeply as possible. It can help to close your eyes. Breathe in slowly through your nose. Hold the breath to the count of seven, then let it slowly out through your mouth to the count of eight (in your head).\n\nTry taking five deep breaths each time you try this practice.\nMake sure you are blowing out fully.\n11. **Consider taking a class.** While classes aren't for everyone, a class can jump start your meditation practice, making it easier for you to make it an everyday practice. Plus, if you have no idea where to begin, a class will help you figure out a good starting point.\n\nLook for meditation centers in your area. Some yoga studios offer meditation classes as well. Also, Buddhist temples or centers in your area will likely offer classes on meditation.\nYou may also find meditation classes through your library or your local parks and recreation department, and some churches offer meditation classes, particularly ones that embrace other traditions, such as the Unitarian Universalists.\n12. **Don't let distraction make you anxious.** Everyone gets distracted when they meditate. When you're first starting out, that may make you anxious or angry at yourself. However, rather than becoming angry, just try to be aware of when your thoughts are drifting, and pull them back to the meditation.\n13. **Realize even a little meditation can help.** That is, you may think you have to meditate every single day at a certain time for it to be helpful. However, if you fall into that thinking, you may find yourself giving up because you miss a few days. Keep in mind that even a little meditation can help improve your memory. Therefore, try to meditate when you can, even if you don't find time to do it every day.\n14. **Try a guided meditation.** If you don't want to take a class, you can still benefit from the wisdom of others. Try doing a guided meditation. You can find many online, or you can download free apps. The person on the other end will walk you through a meditation process, helping you to learn how to do it.\n15. **Change it up.** You don't have to meditate the same way every time. For instance, some people find a walking meditation helpful. Take a ten-minute walk, focusing on different sensations in turn. Start with feeling your body walking, really focusing on what the movements feel like. Move on to the feeling of breathing. After that, focus on what the air feels like on your skin, then try thinking about just what you see and then just what you hear."

                "One of the most neglected spaces when it comes to cleaning a bathroom is the fan. Having a clean, functional fan can lessen bathroom odors, as well as combat mold and mildew growth. These issues can become a health hazard if left unattended for too long. By cleaning your fan around every 6 months, you will be able to remove built up dirt before it becomes a problem.\n1. **Turn off the power.** Before you do anything else, ensure that the fan is turned off and cannot turn back on until you are finished cleaning it. Most models will have a plug that is located directly behind the cover. You could remove the cover first and unplug the fan, but just to be safe, go and temporarily pull the breaker for your bathroom. The fan is now safe to work on.\n2. **Remove the cover.** Dust will fall when the cover is removed. To avoid the dust, position your stepladder such that you can reach the cover, but are not standing directly below it. Most covers will have 2 prongs on opposite sides holding it in place, others just need to be unscrewed. Remove the cover by pressing these prongs in or removing the screws, then set the cover aside.\n3. **Remove the fan.** Unscrew the assembly that is holding the fan in place, then very gently remove the fan. Be careful not to drop the fan or hit it on the side of the exhaust pipe as that could potentially chip the fan blades. Broken fan blades will cause the fan to be louder and less effective.\n4. **Clean the cover and fan.** Start by vacuuming off the majority of the built up grime on both the cover and the fan. Then dip a rag, preferably a microfiber cloth, in soapy water and use it to wipe up the remaining dust. Be as thorough as you can, you will probably not do this again for a while.\nYou can let the cover soak in a tub of hot soapy water, but the fan should be wiped by hand to avoid getting water on the motor assembly or plug.\n5. **Vacuum the exhaust pipe.** Use a crevice or brush attachment and vacuum off the inside of the exhaust pipe. If you can reach, also use your rag or cloth to wipe off what the vacuum could not get.\n6. **Vacuum the external exhaust port.** This can be done later once the entire process is finished, but at some point you should go outside and find the exterior vent for your bathroom fan. Depending on where the bathroom is located, this vent will either be on the roof or the side of your house. Bring a damp rag to wipe off any dirt that has built up on the other end of your exhaust pipe.\n7. **Wipe and vacuum the fan housing.** If your fan had an accessible plug, be careful not to get any water inside the outlet. Doing so could result in electrocution or short circuit the fan when you plug it back in.  Therefore, use a dry rag to wipe off the fan housing, then vacuum up any remaining dust or debris.\n8. **Put the fan back in place.** Before reinstalling the fan, make sure that you cleaned off all the dust from in between each of the blades and dried it thoroughly. Carefully reinsert it into the exhaust pipe and screw the bracing back into place. Use your fingers and spin the fan around a few rotations to make sure that it is not rubbing against anything.\n9. **Turn the power back on.** Plug the fan back into the outlet and reset the breaker for your bathroom. The fan is now dangerous again, so do not touch it or continue to clean it after this point.\n10. **Reinstall the cover.** Once the cover has dried, either screw it back in or bend the prongs until the cover snaps back into place.\n11. **Test the fan.** Turn the fan on again to make sure everything works as normal. The fan should be quieter than it was before and provide a higher amount of air flow."

                "Musty, stinky, odorous old leather bags aren't much fun and it's probable you're not keen to reuse such a bag. Before you resort to throwing it out, there are various ways that might just restore it to a respectable odor again.\n1. **Try a simple clean first.** If this clean doesn't shift the odor, you can try one of the other suggested methods after.\n\nWipe the leather bag inside and out with a clean, dry, soft cloth. This will pick up dust, loose debris and even some mold or mildew.\nWipe the leather bag down with a damp cloth. This will collect even more of the above items.\n2. **Allow the bag to air out.** Choose somewhere outdoors that is sheltered from direct light and heat, such as a table on the porch. Leave for a day if possible.\n3. **Check the odor.** If the bag still smells bad, choose one of the remaining suggested methods, or a combination of the methods.\n4. **Prepare a solution consisting of equal parts of white vinegar and distilled water.** Sponge the bag with the solution. Work on the inside of the bag and any mildewed outside part of the bag for a few minutes.\nIt's a good idea to test a small spot before trying this method, in case it stains.\n5. **Wipe off the vinegar solution with a clean, damp cloth.** \n6. **Allow to air dry.** Place the bag outside under shelter away from direct light to air dry.\n7. **Check the odor.** If it is still there, repeat. If not, the bag can be used again.\n8. **Use liquid detergent soap to clean the bag.** \n9. **Make a solution of soapy water, using the liquid detergent.** Dip the cleaning cloth or sponge in the solution and wring out before using.\n10. **Wipe the cloth over and inside the bag.** Concentrate in particular on the areas that you think are the smelliest.\n11. **Allow to air dry.** Place outside in a sheltered area away from direct sunlight and heat.\n12. **Once dry, check for the odor.** If it lingers, try again.\n13. **Use baking soda to deodorize the bag.** \n14. **Fill a clean sock with baking soda.** Tie off with a knot.\n15. **Place the leather bag and the baking soda-filled sock inside a large resealable plastic bag.** Alternatively, place both items inside an airtight container.\n16. **Set aside.** Let the baking soda work on the bag for at least 24 hours. The odors from the bag should transfer across to the baking soda.\n17. **Remove from the resealable bag or container.** Check the odor of the leather bag; if it still smells bad, repeat the process for another 24 hours, or longer. If it smells good again, throw away the baking soda, wash the sock and use the leather bag again.\n18. **Find some newspaper.** Scrunch the pages up and stuff them inside a large plastic bag, such as a kitchen waste bag or a garbage bag.\n19. **Slide the smelly leather bag in with the newspapers.** Arrange it so that it sits snugly in the middle of the papers.\n20. **Tie the bag up with a knot.** Alternatively, seal with a twist tie.\n21. **Let sit for at least 48 hours.** A few days more won't hurt it.\n22. **Remove from the bag.** Do a sniff test to see whether the odor has gone. If not, return to the bag for a few more days. Eventually it should start to smell better.\n23. **Fill a sock with coffee grounds.** They must be dry grounds, so if you're using grounds from your own coffee making, allow them to fully dry first. Or use the cheap instant coffee granules. Knot it off to keep the coffee intact.\n24. **Place the coffee sock inside your old leather bag.** Leave it there for up to a week. During this time, it should soak up much, if not all, of the cigarette smoke odor.\n25. **Do a smell test.** If all is good, the bag is ready for reuse. If it still smells a little, return the sock for a few more days.\n26. **Make or purchase some potpourri.** Place the potpourri inside a sachet.\n27. **Place the sachet inside the smelly bag.** Leave it there for at least one week.\n28. **Place the bag in an airy place.** Do not leave it in a dark cupboard; instead find somewhere with fresh air and indirect, cool light.\n29. **Check a week later.** It's a good idea to leave the sachet in the bag when using as well, as the scent will continue to improve the bag's own scent."

                "answers": [
                    "Meditation has been scientifically proven to increase focus and memory. You don't have to use any one meditation to help your memory. Using any meditation, such as mindfulness meditation, teaches you to focus your mind. When you're able to focus better, you're also better able to solidify concepts in your short-term memory. Therefore, practicing meditation can help you to develop your short-term memory.\n1. **Start today.** You may be surprised that you don't need to practice meditation for that long to start seeing the effects. One scientific study examined how a group of students responded to meditation.
