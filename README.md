In the dynamic landscape of generative NLP, traditional text processing pipelines limit research flexibility and reproducibility, as they are tailored to specific dataset, task, and model combinations. The escalating complexity, involving system prompts, model-specific formats, instructions, and more, calls for a shift to a structured, modular, and customizable solution.

 Addressing this need, we present Unitxt, an innovative library for customizable textual data preparation and evaluation tailored to generative language models. Unitxt natively integrates with common libraries like HuggingFace and LM-eval-harness and deconstructs processing flows into modular components, enabling easy customization and sharing between practitioners. These components encompass model-specific formats, task prompts, and many other comprehensive dataset processing definitions. The Unitxt-Catalog centralizes these components, fostering collaboration and exploration in modern textual data workflows. Beyond being a tool, Unitxt is a community-driven platform, empowering users to build, share, and advance their pipelines collaboratively.

### ðŸ¦„ Run Unitxt Exploration Dashboard

To launch unitxt graphical user interface first install unitxt with ui requirements:
```
pip install unitxt[ui]
```
Then launch the ui by running:
```
unitxt-explore
```

# ðŸ¦„ Example 

This is a simple example of running end-to-end evaluation in self contained python code over user data.

See more examples in examples subdirectory.

```python
from unitxt import get_logger
from unitxt.api import evaluate, load_dataset
from unitxt.blocks import Task, TaskCard
from unitxt.inference import HFPipelineBasedInferenceEngine
from unitxt.loaders import LoadFromDictionary
from unitxt.templates import InputOutputTemplate, TemplatesDict
from unitxt.text_utils import print_dict

logger = get_logger()

# Set up question answer pairs in a dictionary
data = {
    "test": [
        {"question": "What is the capital of Texas?", "answer": "Austin"},
        {"question": "What is the color of the sky?", "answer": "Blue"},
    ]
}

card = TaskCard(
    # Load the data from the dictionary.  Data can be  also loaded from HF, CSV files, COS and other sources using different loaders.
    loader=LoadFromDictionary(data=data),
    # Define the QA task input and output and metrics.
    task=Task(
        input_fields={"question": str},
        reference_fields={"answer": str},
        prediction_type=str,
        metrics=["metrics.accuracy"],
    ),
)

# Create a simple template that formats the input.
# Add lowercase normalization as a post processor on the model prediction.

template = InputOutputTemplate(
    instruction="Answer the following question.",
    input_format="{question}",
    output_format="{answer}",
    postprocessors=["processors.lower_case"],
)
# Verbalize the dataset using the template
dataset = load_dataset(card=card, template=template)
test_dataset = dataset["test"]


# Infer using flan t5 base using HF API
# can be replaced with any prediction code, 
# including the built in WMLInferenceEngine and OpenAiInferenceEngine.
model_name = "google/flan-t5-base"
inference_model = HFPipelineBasedInferenceEngine(
    model_name=model_name, max_new_tokens=32
)
predictions = inference_model.infer(test_dataset)
evaluated_dataset = evaluate(predictions=predictions, data=test_dataset)

# Print results
for instance in evaluated_dataset:
    print_dict(
        instance,
        keys_to_print=[
            "source", # input to the model
            "prediction", # model prediction 
            "processed_prediction", # model prediction after post processing
            "references", # reference answer
            "score", # scores (per instance and global)
        ],
    )
