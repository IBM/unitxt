Unitxt is a python library for getting data fired up and set for utilization.
In one line of code, it preps a dataset or mixtures-of-datasets into an input-output format for training and evaluation.
We aspire to be simple, adaptable and transperant. 

Unitxt builds on separation. Separation allows adding a dataset, without knowing anything about the models using it. Separation allows training without caring for preprocessing, switching models without loading the data differently and changing formats (instruction\ICL\etc.) without changing anything else.
