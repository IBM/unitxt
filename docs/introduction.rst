Introduction
===================

Unitxt is a Python library for getting data prepared for utilization by language models. In one line of code, it prepares a dataset or mixtures-of-datasets into an sequence to sequence input-output format for training and evaluation. Our aspiration is to be simple, adaptable, and transparent. 

Unitxt builds on the principle of separation. Separation allows adding a dataset without knowing anything about the models using it. It allows for training without worrying about preprocessing, switching models without the need to load the data differently, and changing formats (instruction, in-context learning, etc.) without changing anything else.
