Introduction
===================

In the dynamic landscape of generative NLP, traditional text processing pipelines limit research flexibility and reproducibility, as they are tailored to specific dataset, task, and model combinations.
The escalating complexity, involving system prompts, model-specific formats, instructions, and more, calls for a shift to a structured, modular, and customizable solution.

Addressing this need is `Unitxt`_, an innovative library for customizable textual data preparation and evaluation tailored to generative language models.
Unitxt natively integrates with common libraries like `HuggingFace`_ and `LM-eval-harness`_ and deconstructs processing flows into modular components, enabling easy customization and sharing between practitioners.
These components encompass model-specific formats, task prompts, and many other comprehensive dataset processing definitions.
These components are centralized in the Unitxt-Catalog, thus fostering collaboration and exploration in modern textual data workflows.

Beyond being a tool, Unitxt is a community-driven platform, empowering users to build, share, and advance their pipelines collaboratively.
