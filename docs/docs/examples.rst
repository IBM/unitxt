Evaluate the quality of an LLM as judge
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This example demonstrates how to evaluate an LLM as judge by checking its scores using the gold references of a dataset.
It checks if the judge consistently prefers correct outputs over clearly wrong ones.
Note that to check the the ability of the LLM as judge to discern suitable differences between
partially correct answers requires more refined tests and corresponding labeled data.
The example shows an 8b llama based judge is not a good judge for a summarization task,
while the 70b model performs much better.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This example demonstrates how to use a pre-trained ensemble model or an off-the-shelf LLM as judge to assess multi-turn conversation quality of models on a set of pre-defined metrics.

Topicality: Response of the model only contains information that is related to and helpful for the user inquiry.
`Example code <https://github.com/IBM/unitxt/blob/main/examples/evaluate_ensemble_judge.py>`

Groundedness: Every substantial claim in the response of the model is derivable from the content of the document
`Example code <https://github.com/IBM/unitxt/blob/main/examples/evaluate_grounded_ensemble_judge.py>`

RAG

Evaluate RAG response generation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This example demonstrates how to use the standard Unitxt RAG response generation task.
The response generation task is the following:
Given a question and one or more context(s), generate an answer that is correct and faithful to the context(s).
The example shows how to map the dataset input fields to the RAG response task fields
and use the existing metrics to evaluate model results.

`Example code <https://github.com/IBM/unitxt/blob/main/examples/evaluate_rag_response_generation.py>`_

Multi-Modality
--------------

Evaluate Image-Text to Text Model
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This example demonstrates how to evaluate an image-text to text model using Unitxt.
The task involves generating text responses based on both image and text inputs. This is particularly useful for tasks like visual question answering (VQA) where the model needs to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions.
The example shows how to:

    1. Load a pre-trained image-text model (LLaVA in this case)
    2. Prepare a dataset with image-text inputs
    3. Run inference on the model
    4. Evaluate the model's predictions

The code uses the document VQA dataset in English, applies a QA template with context, and formats it for the LLaVA model. It then selects a subset of the test data, generates predictions, and evaluates the results.
This approach can be adapted for various image-text to text tasks, such as image captioning, visual reasoning, or multimodal dialogue systems.

`Example code <https://github.com/IBM/unitxt/blob/main/examples/evaluate_image_text_to_text.py>`_
