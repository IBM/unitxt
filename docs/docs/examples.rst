   * - Evaluate an existing dataset from the Unitxt catalog
     - Demonstrates how to evaluate an existing entailment dataset (wnli) using Huggingface 
       datasets and evaluate APIs, with no installation required.

   * - Evaluate your question-answering dataset 
     - Demonstrates how to evaluate a user QA answering dataset in a standalone file using a user defined task and template.
     - `code <https://github.com/IBM/unitxt/blob/main/examples/standalone_qa_evaluation.py>`_
     - :ref:`Add new dataset tutorial <adding_dataset>`.
   * - Evaluate your question-answering dataset  - reusing existing catalog assets
     - Demonstrates how to evaluate a user QA dataset using the predefined open qa task and templates.
       It also shows how to use preprocessing steps to align the raw input of the dataset with the predefined task fields.

   * - Evaluate the impact of different formats and system prompts on the same task
     - Demonstrates how different formats and system prompts effect the input provided to a llama3 chat model and evaluate their impact on the obtain scores.

.. list-table:: LLM as a judge
   :widths: 50 50 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - What do you want to do?
     - Description
     - Link to code
     - Related documentation
   * - Evaluate an existing question-answering dataset from the Unitxt catalog, and evaluate it
     - Demonstrates how to evaluate an existing QA dataset (squad) using the Huggingface
       datasets and evaluate APIs and leveraging a predefine LLM as a judge metric.
     - `code <https://github.com/IBM/unitxt/blob/main/examples/evaluate_dataset_by_llm_as_judge_no_install.py>`_
     - | :ref:`Evaluating datasets <evaluating_datasets>`.
       | :ref:`LLM as a Judge Metrics Guide <llm_as_judge>`.
   * - Evaluate your question-answering dataset
     - Demonstrates how to evaluate a user QA answering dataset in a standalone file using a user defined task and template. In addition, it shows how to define an LLM as a judge metric, specify the template it uses to produce the input to the judge, and select the judge model and platform.
     - `code <https://github.com/IBM/unitxt/blob/main/examples/standalone_evaluation_llm_as_judge.py>`_
     - | :ref:`LLM as a Judge Metrics Guide <llm_as_judge>`.
   * - Evaluate an existing summarization dataset from the catalog with LLM as judge
     - Demonstrates how to evaluate a document summarization dataset by define an LLM as a judge metrics, specify the template it uses to produce the input to the judge, and select the judge model and platform.
       The example adds two LLM judges, one that uses the ground truth (references) from the dataset and one that does not.
