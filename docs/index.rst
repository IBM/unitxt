Unitxt: streamlining data processing
=====================================

Unitxt is a Python library for getting data prepared and ready for utilization in training, evaluation and inference of language models.
It provides a set of reusable building blocks and methodology for defining datasets and metrics.

In one line of code, it prepares a dataset or mixtures-of-datasets into an input-output format for training and evaluation.
Our aspiration is to be simple, adaptable, and transparent.
